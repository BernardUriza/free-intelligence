# Microcopys - Free Intelligence

**Card**: FI-UX-STR-001
**Tone**: Technical but friendly, no corporate fluff
**Date**: 2025-10-29

---

## Voice & Tone

**Principles**:
1. **Honest**: No marketing speak. If something failed, say why.
2. **Concise**: 1-2 sentences max. No walls of text.
3. **Technical**: Use correct terms (session, interaction, corpus) but explain when needed.
4. **Empathetic**: Acknowledge user frustration when things go wrong.

**Anti-patterns**:
- ‚ùå "Oops! Something went wrong üòÖ"
- ‚ùå "We're sorry for the inconvenience"
- ‚ùå "Please try again later"

**Good examples**:
- ‚úÖ "Export failed: Disk 90% full. Free up 2GB or change location."
- ‚úÖ "Session saved. Hash: a3f7d8e2..."
- ‚úÖ "Network timeout after 5s. Retry with longer timeout?"
