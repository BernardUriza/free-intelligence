## üéØ What is Free Intelligence?

Free Intelligence (FI) is a **local-first**, **event-sourced** AI consultation system designed for medical settings. It combines:

- **Event Sourcing**: All state changes captured as immutable events
- **SOAP Notes**: NOM-004-SSA3-2012 compliant medical documentation
- **Local LLMs**: Ollama integration for offline operation
- **Audit Trail**: SHA256 hashing for compliance and non-repudiation

**Key Feature**: Your data never leaves your infrastructure. Everything runs on your hardware.
